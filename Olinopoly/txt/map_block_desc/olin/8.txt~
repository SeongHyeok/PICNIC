The Sibbs program builds bridges 
between first-year students and 
upper-class students as well as
between exchange students and 
current Olin students. Volunteer
upper-class Sibbs “adopt” a first
-year or exchange student to help 
her or him adjust to the unique
culture, quirks and inside 
information of Olin.
