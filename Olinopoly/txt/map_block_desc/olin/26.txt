Period when ninjas(tutors) teach ninjees(tutee).
  Ninja stands for Need Information Now Just Ask.
 Here at Olin, we call our course assistants 
NINJAs. They do much more than normal course
 assistants. They are more like tutors that are 
available almost whenever we need them. They
 hold office hours in the lounges, they hold
 tutorials in the labs, and they listen to us
 whine and groan whenever we have too much 
work in their class. They're like little parents.
