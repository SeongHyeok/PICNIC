The Sibbs program builds bridges 
(hence the double “b”) between first-year
 students and upper-class students as well
 as between exchange students and current
 Olin students. Volunteer upper-class Sibbs
 “adopt” a first-year or exchange student
 to help her or him adjust to the unique
 culture, quirks and inside information of Olin.
