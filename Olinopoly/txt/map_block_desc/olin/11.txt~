Students develop detailed concepts and models of authentic new products and services. Focus of this course is on user-oriented, collaborative approaches to design and seeking holistic solutions integrating user and functional perspectives. It emphasizes the importance of process and the development of strategies. Students observe and engage people to develop a deep understanding of their values and the patterns of their lives. They work collaboratively in a studio environment to create a shared understanding of the people they design for (and with) and the product ideas they develop. Topics covered include design thinking, ethnographic methods, concept development and interaction design.
